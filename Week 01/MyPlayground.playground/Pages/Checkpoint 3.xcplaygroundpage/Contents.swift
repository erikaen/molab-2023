 # Checkpoint 3
 This page is a practice from the previous coding.\
 Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:

 1. If it’s a multiple of 3, print “Fizz”
 2. If it’s a multiple of 5, print “Buzz”
 3. If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
 4. Otherwise, just print the number.
